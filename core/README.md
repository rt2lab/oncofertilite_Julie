# Databases

This folder contains the code and documentation for every database
owned by the RT2Lab.

To add a database, please follow the following guidelines:

1. Name your folder using the following pattern:

    ``` text
    <DATABASE-INDEX>_<DATABASE_NAME>/
    ```

2. Your folder should contain the following subfolders:

   * `docs`: for storing the documentation, mapping files, projet descriptions, etc.
   * `src`: for storing code **only**.
